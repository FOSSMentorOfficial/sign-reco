# SIGN RECO
Sign Reco, a type of behavioral biometric, operates in two main modes: static and dynamic.

Static Mode: In this mode, users write their signature on paper. The signature is then digitized using an optical scanner or camera. The biometric system recognizes the signature by analyzing its shape. This mode is often referred to as "off-line."

Dynamic Mode: In this mode, users write their signature on a digitizing tablet, which captures the signature in real-time. Signatures can also be acquired using stylus-operated PDAs, smartphones, or tablets with capacitive screens, where users can sign using their finger or a stylus. Dynamic recognition, also known as "on-line," includes information such as the timing, pressure, and speed of the signature, providing a richer dataset for biometric analysis.
